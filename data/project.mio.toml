## README
# This is a sample configuration file for the moore.io platform
# Although it differs in its language, it serves the same purpose as npm's .npmrc files and follow the same hierarchy: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc#files
# This is essentially a data store used by various mio commands to determine their behavior
